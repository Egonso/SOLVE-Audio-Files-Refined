Assertive Scripts
Another effective solution for establishing boundaries in the moment is "Assertive Scripting."
This involves preparing concise and assertive responses to specific situations where you may need to set or reinforce boundaries.
For example, if someone is consistently interrupting your study time, you can assertively say, "I appreciate our conversations, but right now, I need to focus on my work. Can we catch up later?"
Having these scripts ready empowers you to communicate your needs confidently and ensures you're prepared to handle boundary-related challenges as they arise.
