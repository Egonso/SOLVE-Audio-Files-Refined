Know  Your Limits
Identifying boundaries is the first step in navigating healthy relationships and self-care.
Here’s how you can do it:
First, take time to reflect on your own needs, comfort levels, and priorities in different aspects of your life.
Next, pay attention to situations that make you feel uncomfortable or stretched beyond your limits. When you recognise discomfort, stress or anxiety, make some time to explore what’s behind these feelings as they’re often a sign that a boundary has been crossed.
Recognising these cues will empower you to set clear and respectful boundaries, along with looking after your own wellbeing.
