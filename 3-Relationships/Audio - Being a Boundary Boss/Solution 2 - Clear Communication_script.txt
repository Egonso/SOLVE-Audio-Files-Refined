Clear Communication
Once you’ve set boundaries for yourself, it’s important to be able to communicate them clearly  to avoid confusion and help others see where they stand too.
Here’s how you can do it:
Start by being assertive using “I” statements to show you’re taking responsibility for what you want.
Next, be specific about the type of behaviour that you’re uncomfortable with and the feeling you experience when it happens.
For example: “I feel upset when those words are used to describe me”
Or, "I need some alone time right now,"
Or "I'm not comfortable with that topic of conversation."
