Note to Self
Bullying can be emotionally distressing, causing feelings of self-consciousness and worthlessness.
In these moments, consciously remind yourself of your inherent value and strengths.
Reflect on your achievements, positive qualities, and the support network around you.
Remember, the opinions of bullies do not define you.
You are deserving of respect and kindness, and acknowledging your self-worth is a powerful tool in overcoming the impact of bullying.
