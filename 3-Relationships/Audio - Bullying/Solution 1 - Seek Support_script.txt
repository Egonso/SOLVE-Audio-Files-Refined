Seek Support
One of the reasons bullying continues to be so common is that people don’t always tell someone it’s happening.
No one should face bullying alone and it’s important you do your best to seek support and tell someone what’s going on.
This might include friends, family members, teachers, or school counsellors.
Remind yourself that seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness.
It takes courage to speak up about mistreatment, and you deserve support in navigating through challenging situations.
