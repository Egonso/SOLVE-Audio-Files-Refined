Stand Strong (When Safe)
This involves expressing your feelings and setting clear boundaries.
First, take a deep breath to compose yourself.
Then calmly but firmly address the bully, stating that their behaviour is unacceptable.
Use "I" statements to express how their actions make you feel without escalating the situation.
For example: "I feel hurt when you say or do that, and I want it to stop."
This approach asserts your rights without stooping to the bully's level.
Remember that you have a right to be shown respect.
