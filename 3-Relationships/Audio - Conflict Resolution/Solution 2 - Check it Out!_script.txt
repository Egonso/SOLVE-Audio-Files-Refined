Misunderstandings and assumptions often contribute to conflicts.
We might think we know what someone is thinking, what they’re going to say or how they’re going to react—but that doesn’t mean we’re right!
Making assumptions doesn’t help us resolve conflict, but asking questions and demonstrating curiosity does.
You could ask:
“Just so I’m clear….”
“Can you help me understand…?”
“I want to make sure I’ve got this right…”
“I’m curious, is it…?”
Remember this works both ways so be clear in your communication with others, not assuming people know what you mean!
