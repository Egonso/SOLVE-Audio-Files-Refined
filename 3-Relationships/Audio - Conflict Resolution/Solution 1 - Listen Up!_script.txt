Active listening involves being present so you can fully concentrate, understand and respond appropriately to what’s being said.
We can practice active listening by giving our full attention, making eye contact, providing verbal and non-verbal cues to show we're engaged, along with asking open-ended follow-up questions.
The icing on the cake here is expressing empathy by acknowledging and validating other people’s emotions.
Empathy can sound like: “That sounds really tough”, “I hear you”, “How can I support you with this?”
