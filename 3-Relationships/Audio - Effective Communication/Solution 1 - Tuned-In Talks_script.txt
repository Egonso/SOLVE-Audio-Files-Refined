Tuned-In Talks
Sometimes we think we’re listening to others — when we’re often planning what we’ll say once they’ve stopped talking.
And sometimes we’re actively listening — where we focus on what the other person is saying instead of tuning into our self-talk.
Active listening is about hearing the words and noticing the emotions that are present.
It’s about using verbal (I hear you) and non-verbal cues (nodding in agreement) to demonstrate we’re present with the person.
And it can be about asking open-ended questions to find out more or seek clarification.
