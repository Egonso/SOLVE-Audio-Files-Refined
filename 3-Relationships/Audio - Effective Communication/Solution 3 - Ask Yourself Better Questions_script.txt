Ask Yourself Better Questions
Asking better questions gives us better answers.
Questions are an important part of effective communication because they help us remove assumptions, get clarity and reduce the chance of misunderstandings
Because making assumptions can lead to misunderstandings, it’s important we’re able to recognise when we’re in that thinking trap and get ourselves out of it.
You can do this by asking yourself:
“What evidence do I have for thinking this?”
“Am I basing this judgement on fact or emotion?”
“What other explanations could there be?”
