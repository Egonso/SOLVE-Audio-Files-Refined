It’s Not All About You!
Effective communication is a two-way street.
So, when we’re thinking about what we’ll say next, or thinking about anything but what the other person is saying, we’ve stopped listening and started making it about us.
Here are three ways to practice it better:
Do your best to pause your own story and be present.
Step back from your own experience so you can listen better.
And remember, it’s not about fixing the other person’s problem they’re sharing, it’s about hearing them out — unless they’ve asked us for advice.
