Body Language
Body language is a powerful tool for asserting yourself confidently.
When you stand or sit tall, maintain eye contact, and use open gestures, you convey confidence and assertiveness.
Compare this to slouching forward with your head down, which can make you feel less confident and impact how others perceive you.
By mastering positive body language, you can boost your confidence and project assertiveness in any situation.
The next time you want to look and sound more assertive, simply stand up tall,  lift your head, and roll your shoulders back.
