Words Have Power
Assertiveness involves taking responsibility for your feelings while expressing yourself directly.
One powerful tool for achieving this is using "I" statements.
These statements empower you to express your feelings and needs without placing blame on others.
Here’s how you can use them:
Begin sentences with phrases like "I feel" or "I need" to express your emotions and requirements clearly.
Describe your feelings or needs in specific terms to convey your message clearly.
Avoid blame. Instead of saying, "You always ignore me," try saying, "I feel ignored when I'm not acknowledged in a conversation."
