Pull a Power Pose
During moments of stress, adopting a power pose can be a simple yet effective way to enhance your confidence.
Before you enter the test environment, stand in a posture that exudes strength and self-assuredness—think of a superhero stance, with your chest lifted, shoulders back, and head held high.
You can also take on a seated power pose by sitting tall and upright, shoulders back and head high.
Research in psychology suggests that assuming these postures for just a few seconds can trigger hormonal changes in your body, boosting feelings of confidence and reducing stress.
