4-4-4 Breathing
Panicking is never going to help you in a test situation, so regardless of what shows up on your test paper, know that the one thing you can control is your breath.
Inhale slowly for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.
Why? Because deep breathing helps calm the nervous system, reducing anxiety and promoting focus during the test. It increases oxygen flow to your brain helping you access all that knowledge you’ve been retaining for this test.
You’ve got this.
