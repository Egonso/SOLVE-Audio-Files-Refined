Be Proactive
When faced with a test, instead of passively scanning the text, adopt a more proactive approach.
Here’s how you can do this:
As you read through the questions and passages, underline or highlight key phrases, concepts, and details.
This not only reinforces your understanding of the material but also serves as a valuable reference during the test.
By physically interacting with the text, you can quickly locate and recall essential information.
Moreover, underlining key questioning words ensures that you’re focusing on answering what you’re asked instead of assuming you are.
