Plan, Plan, Plan!
Because ultimately, failing to plan is planning to fail.
How can you plan for better time management?
Carve out time before your week starts to make yourself a weekly schedule so you can plan your time accordingly.
First, pencil things into your schedule that are set in stone and don’t usually change from week to week, such as sports practice.
Next, mark in commitments or things that you only have this week, but are mandatory, such as a dentist appointment.
Once you have an idea of the time you have available for the week, consider upcoming deadlines you need to meet and schedule time to meet those deadlines.
