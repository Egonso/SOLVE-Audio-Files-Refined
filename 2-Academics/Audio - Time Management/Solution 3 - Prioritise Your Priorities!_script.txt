Prioritise Your Priorities!
While it’s easy to fill our time doing things we like, it’s not always helpful!
That’s why it’s important to separate the urgent and important tasks from the not-so-important.
Let’s look at this using the analogy of your tasks as passengers waiting to board a bus.
Urgent and Important: These are passengers who need to get on the bus right away because they're both crucial and time-sensitive. For example, finishing an assignment due tomorrow.
Not Urgent but Important: These passengers are important, but they don't need to board immediately. For example, studying for a test in three weeks.
Urgent but Not Important: These passengers are demanding attention, but they're not essential for your journey and they can wait. Such as checking social media notifications.
Not Urgent and Not Important: These passengers can wait or might even find another bus. Examples include binge-watching TV shows.
