Make a Time Pie
Effective time management is about effective self-management and this starts with a clear understanding of where you’re currently spending your time—that’s where a time pie comes in.
The time-pie exercise involves breaking down your day into segments, much like slicing a pie, to visualise how you spend your time.
Start by identifying categories of activities where you spend most of your time such as school, study and sleep.
Next, allocate each category a portion of your 'time-pie' based on how much time you typically devote to it daily.
Then, ask yourself if these allocations align with your priorities and goals.
By dissecting your day in this way, you gain insights into your time management habits and can make adjustments to change your schedule for success.
