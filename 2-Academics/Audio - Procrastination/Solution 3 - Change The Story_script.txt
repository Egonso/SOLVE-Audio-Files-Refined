Change The Story
The thought of putting something off until later doesn’t just show up on its own — it comes with a story.
It might be a story of “This is too hard”, “I’ll never get it done”, or “It has to be perfect”, for example.
But these stories don’t help you get started so choose a story that does.  Such as: “I’ll break it down into smaller pieces”, “I’ve done this before”, and “Getting started now means I prevent stress later”.
Notice the difference when you tell yourself more helpful stories.
