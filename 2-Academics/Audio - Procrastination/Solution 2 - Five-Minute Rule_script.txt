Five-Minute Rule:
We often procrastinate on projects that seem insurmountable, so make it easy for yourself by committing to working on the task for just five minutes, yes, that’s all just five minutes.
Why? Getting started is often the hardest part because we’ve probably told ourselves it’s going to be hard or even impossible to get done.
By telling yourself it's only for five minutes, you reduce that mental barrier and once you've begun, you might find the momentum to continue.
