Create Tiny Tasks
Your brain doesn’t want to do big projects or anything that seems “hard” or “challenging”, so no wonder it encourages you to put this thing off until later!
However, your brain will say yes to tiny tasks or tasks that seem doable or manageable — so create them. For example: instead of focusing on that three-page essay, start with the title.
Then think about the number of factors or points in your essay, as this will decide the number of paragraphs you need and go from there.
Remember, tiny tasks eventually lead to success!
