Get Active!
OK, we’re not talking about reading while you walk (although you could do a podcast!)
What we are talking about is active studying compared to passive studying.
Passive studying is where you simply read, listen or watch without actively processing or applying the information.
To make your study active, consider the following:
Create visual diagrams, like mind maps, that show the relationships between different concepts.
Engage with the text by highlighting key points, creating connections, jotting down questions, testing yourself, summarising paragraphs or imagining you have to teach the material to someone else.
Engaging actively with the material helps your comprehension and long-term retention—which is what you want.
