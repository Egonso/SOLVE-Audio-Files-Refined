Get Focused!
When you sit down to study, start by setting a specific and achievable outcome for that particular session.
For example, instead of saying you’ll just "Study chemistry," try something like: “I’m going to be able to explain the concept of chemical reactions.” This focused outcome gives your study session a clear purpose and direction.
Then identify the specific topics or tasks you aim to master during the session. This could involve reviewing class notes, completing a set of practice problems, or understanding a particular chapter.
The key is to be detailed in defining what success looks like for that study session.
