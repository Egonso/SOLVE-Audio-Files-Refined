Break Tasks Down
This approach reduces the sense of overwhelm and makes studying more manageable.
Here’s how you can use it:
Write out the tasks related to your exams that you need to do.
Label bigger tasks as projects and break each project down into a series of smaller, achievable tasks, by asking yourself what needs to be done first.
Prioritise these steps based on deadlines.
Find the project or task that’s most important and urgent and start there.
Focus on completing one step at a time.
As you complete each step, tick it off your to-do list and feel that sense of accomplishment.
