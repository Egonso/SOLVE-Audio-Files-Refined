Positive Visualisation:
Visualisation is commonly used by successful athletes, CEOs, politicians etc to get into a successful frame of mind and set themselves up for success.
Here’s how you can use it too:
Picture yourself in the exam room, confidently answering questions.
See yourself feeling in control, calm and confident.
Notice how the information you need comes to you easily once you focus on it, and how you’re answering all the questions in the time allowed.
The more details you can see as you visualise, the more impactful this process is, so feel the texture of the exam paper, and hear the sound of your hand moving on the paper to answer your questions.
The more you visualise your success, the more you’re training yourself to achieve that success.
