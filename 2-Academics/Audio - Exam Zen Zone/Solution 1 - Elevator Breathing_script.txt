Elevator Breathing:
Elevator breathing is a great way to calm your mind and ground yourself so you feel more in control.
Here’s how you can do it:
When stress starts to rise, create a quiet moment for yourself inside the safety of an imaginary elevator.
As you close your eyes, imagine the doors of the elevator gently closing.
Using your breath to control the speed and ascent of the elevator, inhale deeply for a count of three.
Now hold your breath for a count of three to experience the stillness of the top floor — It’s your elevator, it can take you wherever you want!
Using your breath again, exhale slowly until you’re safely on the ground floor again.
Repeat this elevator journey as many times as you need.
