Edit the Story
Recognising that your stress story is not a fixed narrative, but one that can be edited is a helpful first step.
This involves reshaping the way you think, talk about and respond to stressors.
You can begin by changing how you think about stress.
For example: instead of seeing it as something “bad”, see it as part of life and something that helps you grow.
You could also edit your story in terms of how you respond to stress.
For example: instead of telling yourself the story that you can’t handle stress, start telling yourself the story that you handle stress well, and that you’re constantly finding new tools to manage it.
