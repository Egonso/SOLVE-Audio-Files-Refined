It’s Not Permanent
“This is just how things are for me”
Talking about stress as if it’s a permanent fixture in your life is definitely not helpful—or healthy.
Stress doesn’t have a permanent role in your story unless you give it one.
Remind yourself all things are temporary, including stress.
Rather than seeing a challenging situation as permanent or unchangeable, remind yourself that you too have changed and grown a lot already since you were a young child. You’ve overcome stressors and setbacks before and you’ll do it again.
