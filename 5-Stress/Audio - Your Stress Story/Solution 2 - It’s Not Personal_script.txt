It’s Not Personal
“It’s just me; I’m just a stressy person”
Talking about stress as if it’s a part of your character in your stress story, isn’t helpful
It’s part of life, yes, but that doesn’t mean it’s part of you or who you are.
Edit this part of your story by separating yourself from the stressor.
Instead of thinking, “It’s just me!”, remind yourself that stressors are external events that you can learn to navigate.
Don’t make it personal, keep it strictly professional when it comes to dealing with stress!
