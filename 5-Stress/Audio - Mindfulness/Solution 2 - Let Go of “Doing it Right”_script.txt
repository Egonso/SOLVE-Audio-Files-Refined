Let Go of “Doing it Right”
The goal of mindfulness is never to get it “right” or “perfect”.
It’s about being in the moment, noticing when your attention has wandered and then simply bringing your focus back to the here and now.
You can be mindful of any activity at any time you choose.
Start by setting the intention to be mindful, such as when you’re brushing your teeth, speaking with a friend or walking.
Notice the details of these simple activities.
Notice when your attention wanders and be curious about what took it.
Then come back to the activity at hand.
