Let Go of Judgement
A key aspect of mindfulness is being able to park judgement of yourself in the moment.
You can start to do this by simply noticing the thoughts that are occupying your headspace without attaching yourself to them or without judging yourself for having them.
We have thousands of thoughts every day. Some are healthy, fun, comfortable, and exciting and some are not — and that’s OK.
When you catch yourself judging your thoughts, simply remind yourself that your thoughts are just thoughts and you are not your thoughts.
