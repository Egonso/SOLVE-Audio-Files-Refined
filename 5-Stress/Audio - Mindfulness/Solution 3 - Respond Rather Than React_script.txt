Respond Rather Than React
When faced with challenging situations, mindful observation allows you to respond consciously and appropriately rather than react impulsively.
Start by taking a step back and acknowledging your thoughts and feelings.
This gives you time to be aware of your emotions in those moments.
It also helps you understand yourself better by being aware of triggers and your desire to react.
Then ask yourself, “What’s a better way for me to respond here?”
This better question prompts your brain to think of a better response.
And this self-awareness contributes to emotional intelligence, enabling you to navigate stressors with greater understanding.
