Make a To-Do List
Making to-do lists is one way to get organised and stay on top of tasks.
Here’s how you can make them even more effective:
Start by creating a daily or weekly to-do list outlining the tasks and assignments on your plate.
Once you’ve made your list,  prioritise each item based on deadlines and importance.
Next, allocate specific time slots in your schedule for each task—making sure that you’re giving yourself regular breaks and flexibility to meet those deadlines.
With bigger projects or tasks, consider how you can break those down into smaller, manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed.
By following your to-do list diligently, you can effectively manage your time and accomplish tasks more efficiently.
