Breaking it Down
Like all good engineers, we’re going to start with the end in mind and reverse-engineer those bigger projects you’ve got on your plate just now.
Here’s how you can do it:
Start by identifying your end goal, whether it's completing that science project, studying for an exam, or achieving a personal outcome.
Working backwards, break down your goal into smaller tasks or milestones by asking yourself, “What would I have to do first?”
Estimate the time needed for each smaller task or milestone and allocate time on your schedule to do them.
By reverse engineering your goals and tasks, you can effectively plan and manage your time to be successful.
