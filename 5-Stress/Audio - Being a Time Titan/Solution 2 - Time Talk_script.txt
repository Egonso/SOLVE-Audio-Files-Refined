Time Talk
Managing your time effectively means understanding how much time you actually have and how long tasks will take.
Moreover, being realistic about your time helps you plan better and get things done without feeling stressed.
Here's a simple way to do it:
Start by jotting down all your fixed commitments like classes or sports practice in your weekly schedule.
Think about the extra time you need for each commitment, like getting ready or travel time and mark that time into your schedule.
Consider other things you have going on during the week such as meeting friends, family time or prepping for a test.
Now, with your schedule sorted, see how much time you have left for everything else!
