Think Positive Intent
Every behaviour carried out has a positive intention. This means that people act in a way to get, gain, or achieve something important to them.
Sometimes we’re trying to get something for ourselves such as winning or exerting our power.
And sometimes we’re trying to get something for someone else such as showing them we care.
Problems arise when the behaviour doesn’t have a positive impact on everyone else.
Next time you’re faced with a family challenge, step back and ask yourself what the other person or people were trying to achieve: what was their positive intention?
