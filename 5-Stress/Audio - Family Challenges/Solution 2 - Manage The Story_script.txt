Manage The Story
There’s a constant story being narrated in our minds about what we’re experiencing.
Sometimes this story is helpful: “I know Dad means well right now and he’s trying his best”
And sometimes it’s not so helpful: “If they really cared about me, they’d let me go out more”
Knowing the difference between a helpful, empowering story and an unhelpful story is key because it’s not just the story you tell yourself that’s important, but the meaning you place on it.
In one example, the meaning is that Dad is trying his best. But in the second example, the meaning is a lack of care.
Catch the story you’re telling yourself and manage it better.
