Emotional Awareness
If you’re going to navigate family challenges more effectively, you need to be self-aware first.
But what does this mean?
It means being aware of:
Your emotions and what triggers more uncomfortable emotions
How you react when things aren’t going your way
The story that you tell yourself in those moments
Having this information about yourself sets you up to manage challenges better because without this awareness you can’t create the changes needed.
