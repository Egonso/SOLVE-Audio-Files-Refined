Stop Comparing
Whether it’s comparing as you scroll through social media or as you stroll along the street, recognise the impact this has on you and on how you think, talk and act towards your body.
Know that the media often portrays idealised and unrealistic beauty standards.
Accept that beauty is entirely subjective and changes dramatically across cultures, countries and ages.
When you catch yourself comparing your body or appearance to someone else’s, remind yourself that you don’t know their body story and consider the fact that they could equally be comparing themselves to others.
