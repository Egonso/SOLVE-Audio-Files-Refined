Speak
Practice mindful and positive self-talk towards your body, as it listens to every word you say.
Here are three simple ways to incorporate this into your daily routine:
Express Gratitude Verbally: Take a moment each day to verbally express gratitude for your body's abilities and resilience. Acknowledge its strength, vitality, and all the ways it supports you.
Replace Criticism with Compliments: Become aware of moments when you find yourself criticising your body, and consciously replace those thoughts with compliments.
Practice Conscious Appreciation: Make a habit of consciously praising your body for its continual support and presence in your life. Recognise the effort it puts into carrying you through each day and express appreciation for its unwavering dedication.
