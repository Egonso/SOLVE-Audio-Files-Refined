Be Solution-Focused
Sitting around asking yourself why you’re facing this obstacle doesn’t help, but being solution-focused will.
How can you do that?
Start by asking yourself solution-focused questions as this kick-starts your brain into finding you better answers. Ask yourself:
“What do I already know that can help me here?”
“Who do I know that can help me with this challenge?”
“What do I need to do differently to overcome this obstacle?”
“What do I need to remind myself of to overcome this obstacle”
