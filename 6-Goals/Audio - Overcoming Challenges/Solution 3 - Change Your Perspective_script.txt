Change Your Perspective
You always have a choice in how you look at things — including obstacles in your way.
For example, some people see a wall and think, “That’s it. I’ve hit the wall. That’s the end.”
But really, there are plenty of ways to tackle a wall: climb it, leap over it, chip away at it, or find a ladder.
How you choose to view the obstacle in your way matters.
You can stay stuck at the bottom, thinking it's a roadblock, or you can change your view and think about the tools you have to conquer it.
