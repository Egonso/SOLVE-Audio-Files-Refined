Measure for Success
One important rule of goal-setting is making sure you can measure your progress.
Being able to measure your goals helps you track what's working and what's not as you work towards them.
For instance, if you want to improve your fitness, set measurable targets like the number of workouts per week or the distance you aim to cover in a set time.
Ask yourself questions like: "How will I know when I've achieved my goal? What signs will show me I'm making progress? What smaller goals can I set along the way?"
By making your goals measurable, you can keep track of your progress and stay motivated to reach them!
