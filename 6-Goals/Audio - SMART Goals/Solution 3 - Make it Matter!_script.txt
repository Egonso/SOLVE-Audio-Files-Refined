Make it Matter!
When setting goals, it's essential to choose ones that truly matter to you.
Goals that align with your personal values are more likely to keep you motivated, even during challenging times.
To ensure your goals are relevant, ask yourself why achieving them is important to you. Dig deep and consider how they connect to your values and aspirations.
Ask questions like: "Why do I want to achieve this goal? What will it mean for me personally? How does this goal reflect my values and priorities?"
By setting goals that are relevant to your own desires and values, you'll stay motivated and committed to making them a reality!
