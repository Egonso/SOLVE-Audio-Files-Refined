Be Specific
When it comes to setting goals, being specific is key to success.
Instead of vague goals like "Get better grades," break it down into specific details.
For example, if you want to improve your math grade, specify the exact grade you're aiming for and the steps you'll take to get there.
Ask yourself detailed questions like: "What grade do I want to achieve? Why is this important to me? How will I study to reach this goal?"
The more specific you are, the clearer your path to success becomes!
