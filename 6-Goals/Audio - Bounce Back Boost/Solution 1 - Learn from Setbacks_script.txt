Learn from Setbacks
When you face setbacks, it's important to take a step back and learn from them.
Think about what contributed to the setback and how you can use those lessons to move forward.
For example, if Ted knows one reason he didn’t get that role in the school play he wanted was because he didn’t put in enough effort, that’s something he can be mindful of for the next round of auditions.
As you reflect on what happened, try not to be too hard on yourself. Instead of focusing on criticism, look for the lessons you can take away and apply in the future.
By learning from setbacks and using them as opportunities for growth, you'll be better prepared to overcome challenges and achieve your goals!
