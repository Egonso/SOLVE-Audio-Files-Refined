Rewrite Your Setback Story
The way you talk to yourself about setbacks shapes how you deal with them.
Take a look at your setback story and make some edits using the following:
Permanence: Remember, setbacks aren't forever—they're just bumps in the road. You have the power to move past them.
Personal: It's okay to acknowledge your part in the setback, but also consider other factors that played a role.
Prevalent: Just because you faced a setback in one area doesn't mean it's going to affect everything else. Failing one exam doesn't mean you're destined to fail at everything.
By adjusting your setback story with these points in mind, you can respond to setbacks with resilience and move forward with confidence!
