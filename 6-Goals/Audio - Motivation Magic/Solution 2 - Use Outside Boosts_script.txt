Use Outside Boosts
Your external drivers, or external motivators are the fuel that comes from external sources and keeps you going toward your goals.
They might include getting good grades, recognition, praise or rewards from teachers or parents.
When you link your goals to these external boosts, it can amp up your motivation, especially when you're facing challenges.
Just make sure these motivators really matter to you and aren't just random incentives. That way, they'll truly keep you going when the going gets tough!
