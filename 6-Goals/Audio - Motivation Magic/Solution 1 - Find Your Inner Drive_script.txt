Find Your Inner Drive
Your inner drive, or intrinsic motivation, is that fuel that comes from within and keeps you going toward your goals.
It comes from what you truly care about—like the subjects you love, your desire to grow, or your wish to make a difference.
Connecting your goals to these personal passions makes them more meaningful and keeps you committed.
When setting goals, think about why they matter to you personally and how they fit with what you value most.
By finding what drives you, you'll stay motivated and focused on reaching your goals!
