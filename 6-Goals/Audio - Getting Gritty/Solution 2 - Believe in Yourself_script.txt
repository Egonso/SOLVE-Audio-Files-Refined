Believe in Yourself
When things get tough, it's natural for doubts to creep in.
But letting those doubts take over won't help you keep going.
Instead, use them as a signal to switch gears and start believing in yourself.
Think back to all the times you've faced challenges and come out on top.
Remind yourself that tackling difficult things is how you build up your perseverance.
And most importantly, know that you're stronger than you give yourself credit for. Trust in yourself and your abilities—you've got this!
