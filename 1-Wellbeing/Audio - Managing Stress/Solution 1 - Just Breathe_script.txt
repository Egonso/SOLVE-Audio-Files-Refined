Just Breathe
Ever wonder why people often advise, 'Just breathe,' when stress hits? It's because longer, slower, deeper breaths have a calming effect on our nervous system.
These breaths send a signal to our brain that there's no immediate threat, helping to alleviate stress.
Moreover, when we take deeper breaths, more oxygen reaches our brain, promoting clearer thinking compared to shallow, rapid breaths.
Try it now by taking a deep breath in for a count of three.
Holding that breath for a count of three.
And slowly exhaling for a count of three.
