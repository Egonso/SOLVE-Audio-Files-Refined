Manage Your Self-talk
Sometimes we’re the source of our own stress because of how we talk to ourselves.
We might tell ourselves that nothing ever works out for us, or that we’ll never get something done on time.
But these words and phrases don’t help us manage stress and can actually make it worse.
Telling yourself you need to do “everything” or “get it all done perfectly” are ingredients for a stress recipe.
To change your self-talk, start tuning into those “All or nothing” words such as “Always”, “Never”…
Then replace them with something more helpful such as “I will get this done step by step”, “I’m just finding this hard .. at the moment”, “I haven’t figured this out… yet”
Be mindful of how you’re potentially adding to your stress experience through your self-talk.
