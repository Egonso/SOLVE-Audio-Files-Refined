Step into Courage
Combat fear by seeing and feeling yourself acting courageously.
When fear rears its head, imagine what it would feel like to act courageously in the face of it. What would you look like? What would you be telling yourself in those moments?
Close your eyes and vividly imagine a scenario where you confront and overcome the source of your fear. See the steps you take, the tools you have to fight that fear, and your ultimate success.
This mental rehearsal not only reduces fear but also empowers you with a solution-focused mindset.
