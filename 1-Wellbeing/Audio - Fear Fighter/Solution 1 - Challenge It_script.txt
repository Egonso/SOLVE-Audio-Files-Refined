Challenge It
Our fears can be real (when there’s an actual threat to our survival) or imagined (when we think something awful will happen).
So, when fear shows up, one of the first things to do is challenge how real it is.
Ask yourself, "Is this fear real?", “Is there a real threat to my safety?” and "What evidence supports or contradicts this fear?"
By actively challenging the fear, you gain a clearer understanding of what you’re dealing with and this helps you to manage it better in the moment.
