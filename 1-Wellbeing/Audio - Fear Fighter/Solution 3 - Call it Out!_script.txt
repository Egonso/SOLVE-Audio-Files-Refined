Call it Out!
Fear wins when we run the other way, cower down and just play it safe... but that’s not always good for our personal growth.
To move past fear, begin by acknowledging and accepting that it’s there.
“I see you, fear, and I’m still here!”
Next, call it out: shine a light on it and find out what it’s hoping to achieve by showing up.
Ask yourself, What am I really afraid of here? What’s the fear trying to protect me from? How long do I want to stay in this fear?
You can then decide what you want to do with that information and if you’d like to still show up in the face of fear.
