Press Pause
Pressing pause empowers you to navigate emotions consciously,  helping you create a more balanced response in the heat of the moment.
Here’s how you can do it:
When faced with an uncomfortable emotion, resist the urge to react immediately, and press pause in your mind by taking a long, slow deep breath.
During this pause, acknowledge the emotion that has shown up and consider what it’s trying to teach you about yourself.
Now, knowing there’s value in this emotion, you can intentionally choose how you want to respond.
