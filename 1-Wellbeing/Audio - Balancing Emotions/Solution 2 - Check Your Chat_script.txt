When a strong emotion shows up pay attention to the dialogue running in your mind.
If you notice negative or self-defeating thoughts like, "I can't handle this" or, "I always mess up," consciously challenge and change those thoughts.
Replace, "I can't handle this" with "I've overcome challenges before, and I can handle this one too."
Change, "I always mess up" to, "Mistakes are opportunities to learn, and I can grow from this experience."
By reframing your self-talk, you reshape the narrative, creating space for more balanced emotions in challenging situations.Top of Form
