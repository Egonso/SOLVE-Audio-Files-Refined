Name & Nurture
Start by specifically naming the emotion you're experiencing.
Is it frustration, sadness, or anxiety…?
Once you’ve acknowledged it, accept that it’s there, knowing that experiencing all emotions is part of being human.
If you’re struggling to accept the emotion, approach it with curiosity by asking, “What’s got me feeling this way?”
This curiosity is nurturing and a kinder way to approach uncomfortable emotions, rather than criticising yourself.
By naming, accepting, and being curious you’re more able to manage and balance your emotions.
