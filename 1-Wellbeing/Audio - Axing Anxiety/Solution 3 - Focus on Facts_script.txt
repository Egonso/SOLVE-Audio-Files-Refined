Focus on Facts
Start by acknowledging and naming the emotion you're experiencing in the moment, such as "I am feeling anxious."
Next, try to identify the underlying cause of your anxiety. For example, you might realise that you're anxious because of an upcoming school event or assignment.
Once you've identified the source of your anxiety, challenge it by focusing on the facts.
Here are three examples:
"This anxiety is unhelpful, but I can manage it because…I have the tools to do so”
"I've handled situations like this before, such as when… I gave a presentation in French class last week."
"I am stronger than I realise because… I've overcome challenges before, and I can do it again."
By focusing on the facts and challenging the underlying thoughts contributing to your anxiety, you can reduce its hold on you and regain a sense of control.
