Box Breathing
Deep breathing, like box breathing, helps to ease anxiety by sending a message to your brain that there is no threat and you are safe.
With this technique, essentially, what you’re doing is creating a box shape with your breath.
Start by inhaling slowly and deeply through your nose for a count of four.
Then hold your breath for a count of four.
Next, exhale slowly and completely through your mouth or nose for a count of four.
And lastly, pause and hold your breath for another count of four.
Repeat the process for several rounds until you start to feel a sense of calm.
