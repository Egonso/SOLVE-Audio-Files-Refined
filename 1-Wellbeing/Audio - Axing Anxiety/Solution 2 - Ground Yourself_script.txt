Ground Yourself
Because anxiety lives in the future, being able to be present or ground yourself in anxious situations is helpful.
Use the following exercise to draw your attention to the here and now:
Start by identifying three things you can see around you. It could be anything from a book on a shelf to the colour of the walls.
Next, identify three things you can physically touch right now. It might be the texture of a surface, the warmth of your hands, or the feeling of clothing against your skin.
Now, listen carefully to your surroundings and pick out three distinct sounds. It could be the hum of a computer, the rustling of leaves, or distant traffic noise.
Repeat this exercise as needed.
