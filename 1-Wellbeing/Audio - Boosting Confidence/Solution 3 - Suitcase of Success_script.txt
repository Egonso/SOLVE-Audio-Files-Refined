Suitcase of Success
In times of self-doubt, we can be quick to forget all the successes we’ve accomplished so far — this is where your suitcase of success comes in.
In this suitcase, you have packed the following:
All the hurdles you’ve overcome  — big and small
The several skills you’ve mastered
The goals you’ve achieved
The strengths you possess
All the compliments you’ve ever received
That’s a LOT to unpack right there!
Notice all of these successes as you unpack each one, seeing how each one is evidence of your resilience and capabilities.
These are reminders that you’ve conquered challenges before, and you have the strength to do so again.
