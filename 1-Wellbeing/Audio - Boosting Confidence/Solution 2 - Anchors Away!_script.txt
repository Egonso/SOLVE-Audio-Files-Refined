Anchors Away!
If you’ve ever experienced confidence before, you can get those feelings again through a simple exercise called anchoring.
Recall a specific time when you felt incredibly confident.
As you close your eyes, vividly relive that experience now — hear what you heard, see what you saw and feel what you felt.
When you recognise that you’re back in that confident state, you can “anchor” it by gently tapping your wrist, or your thumb and finger together. This helps your brain to connect or anchor the memory to the tapping.
Whenever you need a confidence boost all you need to do is tap into your confidence anchor and you’re away!
