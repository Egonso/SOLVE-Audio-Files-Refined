Stand up for Confidence!
The way we carry ourselves greatly impacts our level of confidence.
Notice the difference now as you stand (or sit) up tall, shoulders back, head held high, compared to when you hunch or slouch forward, head hanging down.
The first posture conveys confidence and signals to your brain that it’s time to feel more assertive.
The second posture signals self-doubt and uncertainty.
By changing your posture you can influence your mind to instantly give you a confidence boost.
So, before facing a challenge or entering a room, take a moment to stand in a way that exudes confidence.
