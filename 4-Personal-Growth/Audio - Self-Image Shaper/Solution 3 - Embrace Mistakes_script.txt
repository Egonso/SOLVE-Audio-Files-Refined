Embrace Mistakes:
You always have a choice in what you choose to do with the mistakes you make (And you’re going to make them because you’re only human after all)
You can let these mistakes define you, spending time wallowing in them and asking yourself why.
Or, you can reframe them by viewing them as opportunities for growth and recognise them as stepping stones to your future success.
When faced with a mistake, ask yourself, "What can I learn from this?"
Keep in mind that rarely do people learn from success — even the most successful people in the world — they’ve learned from their mistakes.
