Positive Self-Talk
Your self-talk is a powerful tool that can motivate, inspire and encourage you — so use it wisely!
Consciously catch unhelpful chat from your inner critic and replace it with optimistic and supportive self-talk from your inner coach.
For example, if you catch yourself thinking, "I can't do this," replace it with, “I can’t do this yet, but I’ll figure it out”.
Remind yourself that you are capable and worthy, and you can handle whatever life throws at you.
