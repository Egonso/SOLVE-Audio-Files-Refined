Trapping Thoughts
Learning to manage unhelpful thoughts when they show up is crucial or we risk falling from one thinking trap into another.
One way to do this is to challenge those thoughts and examine the “evidence” you feel you have to support them.
For example: A common thinking trap is all-or-nothing thinking, such as “Nothing good happened to me at all today, nothing. Nothing ever goes well for me.”
But when you look at the situation through a pair of logical lenses, you’re likely to find there’s a lot more to that story than you think. It’s just that sometimes we’re focusing on the “bad” stuff instead of having a wider view.
Manage those pesky thoughts better by looking at things through a more logical lens.
