Question Your Inner Narrator
Ask your brain a question and it will give you an answer.
Ask your brain a better question and it will give you a better answer.
For example: Mike asks himself why he’s finding things so difficult at the moment and his brain tells him it’s because he’s not good enough, he isn’t working hard enough, etc.
But when he asks himself a better question such as: “How can I make this easier for myself?” or, “What’s a better way for me to think about this right now?” His brain will give him more action-oriented and solution-focused answers — which is what we want.
Ask Yourself the following questions will help:
“Who can help me with this?”
“What do I already know about this?”
“How can I approach this differently?”
