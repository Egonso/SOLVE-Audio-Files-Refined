Be Self-Aware
The first step in overcoming thinking traps is to become a detective of your thoughts because unless you’re aware you’re thinking these things, you can’t do anything about them.
Start by observing your thinking patterns without judging them or yourself. Remember that thinking you get things wrong all the time, does not mean you actually do.
Next, when you catch yourself falling into a thinking trap, take a mental step back and question how true these thoughts are.
Then challenge these unhelpful thoughts to get a clear, logical and realistic view of what’s really going on.
