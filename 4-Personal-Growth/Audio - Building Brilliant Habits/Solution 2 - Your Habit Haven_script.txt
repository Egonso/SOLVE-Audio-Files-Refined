Your Habit Haven
Where you hang out can strongly  influence your habits.
Making your space work for you means setting it up to support the habits you're aiming for while cutting out the distractions.
For example, if you aim to develop a reading habit, set up a cosy reading nook with minimal electronic devices, or consider arranging study materials in a way that makes them easily accessible.
Get clear about the habit you’d like to develop and ask yourself how you can create an environment that will help you do just that.
