The Habit Hack
Creating awesome habits is all about understanding and tweaking the Habit Loop (Cue-Routine-Reward) to help you get what you want.
For instance, let's say you're stressed out (cue), and your go-to move is scrolling through social media, and that gives you a little sense of calm (reward).
But, if you're tired of wasting time on your phone, you can mix it up by changing your routine.
Instead of scrolling, try taking a quick mindfulness break or chatting with a friend.
By consciously shaping this loop, you can train your habits to work for you in the best way possible!
