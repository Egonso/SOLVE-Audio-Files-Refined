Stack Those Habits
Imagine building habits like stacking building blocks—each small routine forming a sturdy foundation for positive change.
Habit stacking is where you attach your new habit to an existing one, such as doing a quick review of notes immediately after having breakfast or journalling for a few minutes after you’ve brushed your teeth at night.
This way, established habits act as cues for the new ones, making it easier to integrate them into your daily routine.
