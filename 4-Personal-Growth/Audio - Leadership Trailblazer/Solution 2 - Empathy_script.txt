Empathy
It's the ability to step into others' shoes, understand their perspectives, and genuinely connect on an emotional level.
A Leadership Trailblazer, equipped with empathy, recognises the diverse strengths and challenges within their team, fostering an inclusive environment where every voice is heard.
Ultimately, empathy isn't just a leadership skill; it's the foundation for building meaningful relationships.
Here are three ways to do it better:
Don’t assume what someone is experiencing — ask them
Validate that experience: “That sounds tough for you”
Make the person feel heard: “I hear how important that is for you”
