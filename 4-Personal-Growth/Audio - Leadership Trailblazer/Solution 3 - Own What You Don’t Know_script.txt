Own What You Don’t Know
Admitting, accepting, and owning what you don't know is a hallmark of authentic leadership, that signifies strength rather than weakness.
When a leader openly admits areas of uncertainty, it creates an environment of transparency and trust and allows other people to share what they know.
Here are three ways to do it better:
Say it with confidence: "I'm not familiar with that. Can you share more about it?"
Recognise the strengths of other team members: “Jane, you’re great at this, can you help us here?”
Share your desire to learn: “I don’t have all the answers here, but I know together we’ll find great solutions”
