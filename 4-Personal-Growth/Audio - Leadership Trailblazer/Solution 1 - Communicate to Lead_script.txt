Communicate to Lead
Leadership hinges on effective communication.
It's not just about conveying information but ensuring that the message resonates, inspires, and fosters a shared understanding.
Beyond speaking, effective communication involves active listening—a skill that acknowledges the value of every perspective within the team.
Here are three ways to do it better:
Listen to what’s really being said
Ask questions to clarify and remove assumptions
Pause the story in your head and be present with the other person
