Progress Pause
Imagine you're on a road trip — you'd probably keep an eye on your map regularly to make sure you're headed in the right direction, right?
Similarly, tracking your goals helps you see how far you've come, how you’re doing, what needs to change and what's left to do.
Without regularly reviewing your goals, it can be easy to veer off track and end up anywhere!
Here’s how you can do it:
Make sure you’ve got clear measures of success for yourself. These can be quantitative (such as numbers & percentages)  and qualitative (such as feeling more confident).
Set aside dedicated time (such as weekly or monthly) to review your goals and progress.
Acknowledge and celebrate your successes, no matter how small, to maintain motivation and momentum.
And lastly, identify any obstacles in your way and explore strategies to overcome them.
