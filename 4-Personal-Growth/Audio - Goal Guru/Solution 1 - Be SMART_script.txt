Be SMART:
Goal-setting begins with creating SMART goals.
This means that your goals need to be:
Specific: Get crystal clear about what it is that you’re working towards.
Measurable: Make sure you can measure your goal success, both at the end and along the way by setting up milestones.
Achievable: Set yourself up for success by having achievable, yet challenging goals.
Relevant: Know what makes this goal important to you.
Time-bound: Have a time for achieving your goal and a time frame for that journey.
